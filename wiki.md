**EPIC: the Musical** is a musical adaption of Homer's The Odyssey by Jorge Rivera-Herrans. It is heavily documented on Jorge's TikTok, amassing about 60 million views across *TikTok*. It also received multiple number 1 soundtracks on ITunes upon release.


## Songs
The concept album consists of 40 songs spanning multiple genres, splitting into two acts fo consistent themeing between the two. The songs have garnered 5 million streams at the very least, and older ones even have over 10 million streams. Upon release, they often make number 1 spots. 

### Sagas
Epic the Musical has over 40 songs, which consist of 9 sagas that explain each "arc" of Odysseus' story. The first act consist of Troy Saga, the Cyclops Saga, the Ocean Saga, the Circe Saga, and the Underworld Saga. The second act consists of the Thunder Saga, the Wisdom Saga, the Vengeance Saga, and the Ithaca Saga.

## Themes
A few of the themes that are prevalent in the musical is the theme of "Ruthlessness". "Ruthlessness" is how many characters justify their actions. For example, when Polyphemus in the Cyclops Saga is hurt from his favorite sheep being killed, he responds by lashing out at Odysseus' crew, thinking that if none of the crew survives, the rest of his sheep will remain untouched. Similarly, since Polyphemus is Poseidon's son, Poseidon enacts justice by killing off a majority of Odysseus' crew as punishment. These are all referenced in the final song of Act 1: "Monster", where they explain that in being "Ruthless" they protect themselves and their own, but tend to be seen as losing their humanity in the process.
